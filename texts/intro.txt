The year is 2176. You are an employee of a corporation that specializes in space
exploration. This company has been developing an experimental spacecraft with a drive 
that allows it to travel at almost the speed of light - the Atalanta. 

After extensive testing within the solar system, the Atalanta was sent on its first
mission to an exoplanet: Proxima Centauri b, about 4.2 light-years from Earth.
Due to the incredible force of acceleration and the length of the trip, the crew
were placed in hypersleep pods specially designed to protect them from the dangers
of light-speed travel.

Instead of reaching its destination, however, the Atalanta's engines stopped firing
and it fell into a slowly decaying orbit around Jupiter, on the other side of the 
asteroid belt. It has not sent out a distress signal, and has not responded to any 
attempts to contact it.

You are an engineer, and you work on the most challenging tasks your company faces. 
You were repairing a mining vessel in the asteroid belt when the ship stopped near 
Jupiter, and based on your skill-set and proximity, your company tasked you with 
traveling to the ship, investigating, and performing repairs as needed. Further 
assistance is on the way, but will not arrive for over a month. Your journey took
only a week.

When you arrive on the scene, you are amazed at the size of the Atalanta. All of the
systems necessary to support its drive array must require a lot of space. There may
be a lot of work to do. Time to get started ...
