# Text Adventure Game

This is a text-based adventure game written using Python. I always enjoyed these, and felt like developing one would be a fun exercise. I hope you enjoy it!

To run the game, simply clone the repository, navigate into it on your local machine, and type `python3 game.py`.
*N.B. This game is written using Python 3. Sorry Python 2 fans!*
